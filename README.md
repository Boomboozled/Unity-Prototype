# Unity-Prototype

STILL IN PROGRESS ON MAKING THIS PROJECT MORE PRESENTABLE TO PUBLIC

This is a Unity Project I made that prototyped some game mechanics and AI without the use of Navmeshes.



I spent around 3 months learning Unity and familiarizing myself with the engine. After thinking more towards the future, I switched to Unreal Engine and have since then stopped working in Unity.
